Contact:
I am currently looking for a job this summer 2023 in the development industry.
Please reach out if you have a career opportunity or a project inquiry if you feel I could be of help.

About:
With an open mind to different ranges of solutions, 
my goal is to continue broadening my software development knowledge
spanning the entire stack, with attention to detail.
I am currently attending the second year of the Software Engineering
bachelor program at Blekinge Institute of Technology in Karlskrona, Sweden.
On the side of creating computer programs, I also love
creating other forms of digital work, such as video and audio,
where I have a decade of on- and off engagement.

Projects:
Task Scheduler:
My first web project, made with no prior experience in the React stack in 100 hours total.

Experience:
I'd like to think
